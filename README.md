## Reporter

This is a short Roll20 script that reports to chat a single attribute for a group of selected tokens. If you grab a group of tokens and want to know all of their strength attributes in a single report for example, this will do it.

The commands are either

**!report-token** to return a token attribute

**!report character** to return a character sheet attribute

This must be followed by a space and two dashes preceding the resquested attribute. Examples:

- !report-token --token_name

- !report-character --strength
